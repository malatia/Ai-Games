# Ai Games

This project enables you to train little AI games locally directly in the browser. First, you run a local server, register (it's all local, nothing goes to the web), and then login with your registered account, and you can finally have access to the games!

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Just run app.py and go to 127.0.0.1:5000
